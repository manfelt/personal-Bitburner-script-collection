# personal-Bitburner-script-collection
A collection of my own bitburner scripts. Should I later return to Bitburner, I have these to fall back to.


Usage
===============

Simply, run sendshit. It will appraise servers and scp-send each an alt-superscript, and run it with as many threads as the target server RAM allows.

```objc
run sendshit.js
```

There's also the 'raml√∂sa', which targets servers without RAM, utilizing home RAM instead:
```objc
run ramlosa.js
```

Or from home, run alt-superscript. It's the go-to script that checks a target server, and acts upon it according to security and money.
```objc
run alt-superscript.js -t 10 zer0
```

With the stock exchange API, aksjer/kontroll.js activates a custom-made stock system. It's input is the amount of currency it can invest in each stock:
```objc
run kontroll.js 100000000
```
